    n_dof_lost(D::Integer, constraint_clusters)

Calculate the number of degrees of freedom lost from the system due to the constraints.

All constrained molecules with 3 or more atoms are assumed to be non-linear.
The table below shows the degrees of freedom for different types of structures in the
system where D is the dimensionality.
When using constraint algorithms the vibrational degrees of freedom are removed from a molecule.

| Rotational    |     0      |     D - 1       |        D            |
| Vibrational   |     0      |  D*N - (2D - 1) |    D*N - 2D         |
| Total         |     D      |      D*N        |       D*N           |
